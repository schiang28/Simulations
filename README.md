1. Platonic Solids

In geometry, a Platonic solid is a convex, regular polyhedron in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent regular polygons, and the same number of faces meet at each vertex.

3D demonstration including tetrahedron (or pyramid), cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.
